    "### Predicting the cantica\n",
    "We now turn to prediction for a given tercet $t$. Again, we can represent the tercet in terms of its tokens\n",
    "$x = [x_1, x_2, ..., x_N ]$ (here $N$ refers to the length of the validation tercet, and $x_i$\n",
    "is the $i$-th word of the tercet). <br>\n",
    "As said before, the likelihood of a word $x$ is expressed as:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(x \\mid c) = P(x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_N \\mid c) = \\prod_{i=1}^{N} P(x_i \\mid c)\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\\log P(x \\mid c) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\log \\pi_{c, x_i}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "**So, in order to compute the log-likelihood of each word, we have to sum all the log-probabilities of each word.** <br>\n",
    "Let's consider a scenario where we are predicting the cantica for a tercet. Suppose we have the following words in the tercet: \n",
    "$$\n",
    "x = [x_1, x_2, x_3] = [\\text{fire}, \\text{burning}, \\text{night}]\n",
    "$$\n",
    "We also have the word probabilities (calculated from the MLE) for a specific cantica, say *Inferno*, stored in $\\pi_{\\text{Inferno}, x}$, which represents the probability of each word occurring in the *Inferno* cantica.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this example, suppose the probabilities for each word are as follows:\n",
    "- $P(\\text{fire} \\mid \\text{Inferno}) = 0.2$\n",
    "- $P(\\text{burning} \\mid \\text{Inferno}) = 0.3$\n",
    "- $P(\\text{night} \\mid \\text{Inferno}) = 0.1$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can calculate the log-likelihood for this tercet in the *Inferno* cantica as:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\log P(x \\mid \\text{Inferno}) = \\log \\{P(\\text{fire} \\mid \\text{Inferno}) \\cdot P(\\text{burning} \\mid \\text{Inferno}) \\cdot P(\\text{night} \\mid \\text{Inferno})\\}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Using the formula for the log of a product, we get:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\log P(x \\mid \\text{Inferno}) = \\log P(\\text{fire} \\mid \\text{Inferno}) + \\log P(\\text{burning} \\mid \\text{Inferno}) + \\log P(\\text{night} \\mid \\text{Inferno})\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Substituting the values, we have:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\log P(x \\mid \\text{Inferno}) = \\log 0.2 + \\log 0.3 + \\log 0.1\n",
    "$$\n",
    "This simplifies to:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\log P(x \\mid \\text{Inferno}) \\approx -1.6094 - 1.2040 - 2.3026 = -5.116\n",

    "## Model #2\n",
    "We can now introduce another model, slightly similar to the first one. Here the focus is related to the **occurrencies of each word**. In this case we have $M$ random variables $Y_j \\in \\mathbb{N}$ which describe how many times each token $x_i$ (which in the previous model was considered a random variblae but here it's not) compares in the text to analyze. So we can formalize all of this this way: <br>\n",
    "Let the document be represented by a sequence of tokens:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "x = [x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_N]\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We define $M$ random variables $Y_1, Y_2, \\dots, Y_M$ where each $Y_j \\in \\mathbb{N}$ denotes the number of occurrences of word $j$ in the document.\n",
    "\n",
    "The relation between the previous model (with $X_i$) and the new model is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Y_j = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\mathbb{I}[X_i = j]\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mathbb{I}[X_i = j]$ is the indicator function, equal to 1 if the $i$-th word is $j$, and 0 otherwise. <br>\n",
    "So, for example: <br>\n",
    "Let  \n",
    "$$\n",
    "x = [x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_6] = [\\text{love}, \\text{hope}, \\text{love}, \\text{peace}, \\text{hope}, \\text{hope}]\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we can define these random variables:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Y_{\\text{love}} = \\sum_{i=1}^6 \\mathbb{I}[x_i = \\text{love}] = 2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Y_{\\text{peace}} = \\sum_{i=1}^6 \\mathbb{I}[x_i = \\text{peace}] = 1\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Y_{\\text{hope}} = \\sum_{i=1}^6 \\mathbb{I}[x_i = \\text{hope}] = 3\n",
    "$$\n",
    "This rapresentation is often called **Bag of Words** (*BoW*). We assume a **Multinomial distribution** for our new random variables, because we consider each word occurrence to be an **independet draw** from the **categorical distribution** over the vocabulary of words, and then we count how many times the words occurr in the document, so we can formalize everything this way:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "(Y_1, Y_2, ..., Y_M) \\sim \\text{Multinomial}(N, \\Pi)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $N = \\sum_{j=1}^{M} Y_j$ is the total number of tokens of the text, computed summing all the occurrencies of each word together\n",
    "- $\\Pi = \\left[ \\pi_{c, 1}, \\pi_{c, 2}, ..., \\pi_{c, M}\\right]$ are the class-conditional probabilities of each word given class $c$, so they're again the model parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we can calculate the likelihood by recalling the formula for the Multinomial density:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathcal{L}_Y(\\mathbf{\\Pi}) = \\frac{N!}{y_1! \\dots y_M!} \\prod_{j=1}^{m} \\pi_j^{y_j} = \\frac{N!}{N_1! \\dots N_M!} \\prod_{j=1}^{m} \\pi_j^{N_j}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "since $y_j$ is the number of occurrences of word $j$, i.e. $y_j = N_j$. The log-likelihood is thus\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\ell_Y(\\mathbf{\\Pi}) = \\log \\mathcal{L}_Y(\\mathbf{\\Pi}) = \\xi + \\sum_{j=1}^{m} y_j \\log \\pi_j = \\xi + \\sum_{j=1}^{m} N_j \\log \\pi_j\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the term $\\xi$ is the logarithm of the multinomial coefficients, which is constant with respect to the model parameters $\\Pi = \\left[ \\pi_{c, 1}, \\pi_{c, 2}, ..., \\pi_{c, M}\\right]$, so we don't consider it when maximizing the log-likelihood. <br>\n",
    "Apart from the constant, **this is exactly equal to the log-likelihood of the first model!**\n",
    "So we can write:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathcal{L}_X(\\mathbf{\\Pi}) \\propto \\mathcal{L}_Y(\\mathbf{\\Pi}) \\\\\n",
    "\\ell_X(\\mathbf{\\Pi}) \\propto \\ell_Y(\\mathbf{\\Pi})\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Since the likelihoods are proportional, **inference** will be the same using te Maximum Likelihood Approach (because we are trying to mazimize two proportional functions):\n",
    "- ML estimates will be the same for both models (the terms $\\xi$ is irrelevant for maximization)\n",
    "- Likelihood ratios and class posterior probabilities will also be the same, since the proportionality term $\\alpha = e^{\\xi}$ simplifies\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, **from an implementation point of view, the computational steps of the second model are the same as the first one. The only difference is that we work with word counts instead of word sequences.** <br>\n",
    "The results, obviously, will be **the same**."
